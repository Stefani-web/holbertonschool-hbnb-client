## Project Overview
This project involves the front-end development of the HBnB application using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6. The goal is to design and implement an interactive user interface that connects with the back-end services developed in previous parts of the project.

## Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly interface following provided design specifications.
- Implement client-side functionality to interact with the back-end API.
- Ensure secure and efficient data handling using JavaScript.
- Apply modern web development practices to create a dynamic web application.

## Requirements
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **JavaScript ES6**
- **AJAX/Fetch API**
- **Flask==3.0.3**
- **Flask-JWT-Extended==4.6.0**
